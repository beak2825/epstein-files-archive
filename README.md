# epstein-files-archive
This is not archiving the files themselves, this is only archiving the server responses, useful for checksum and Last-Modified


This Python script fetches metadata (HTTP headers) for files from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Epstein disclosures datasets available at https://www.justice.gov/epstein/doj-disclosures. It processes each dataset sequentially, handling pagination, and saves selected response headers to text files without downloading the actual file contents. It also compiles a universal log of file names with their Last-Modified dates and ETags.
